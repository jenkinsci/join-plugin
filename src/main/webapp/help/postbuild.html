Run certain post-build actions once the join is achieved.  The authors of the post-build actions
did not have the join plugin in mind when writing their actions, so only a select few are shown here.

<p>The join plugin can work with the paramaterized-trigger plugin, version 2.30 or later.   Earlier versions
will experience a NPE when started by the join plugin.

<p>If there is a post-build action you would like to see supported, <a href="https://issues.jenkins.io/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa">please file an issue</a>.   Use the 'join' component.
But do <a href="https://issues.jenkins.io/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&reset=true&jqlQuery=project+%3D+JENKINS+AND+status+in+%28Open%2C+%22In+Progress%22%2C+Reopened%29+AND+component+%3D+%27join-plugin%27">check the list of join plugin issues</a> first.
